# Bot Changelog - v3.5.0

## December 13, 2025

### 🔧 Persistent Maintenance Mode

**CRITICAL FIX:** Maintenance mode now persists across bot restarts!

#### Changes
- Added `_load_maintenance_state()` method in `core/bot.py`
- Bot reads `config/maintenance_state.json` on startup
- If maintenance was active before restart, it remains active
- Logs show "🔧 Maintenance mode ACTIVE from previous session" on startup

#### How It Works
1. When you enable maintenance from dashboard, state is saved to `maintenance_state.json`
2. When bot restarts, it reads this file and restores maintenance state
3. Maintenance stays active until you manually complete/disable it from dashboard
