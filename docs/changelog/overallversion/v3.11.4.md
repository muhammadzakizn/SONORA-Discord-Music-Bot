# SONORA v3.11.4 - Balanced 50:50 Layout

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview
Fine-tuned the fullscreen lyrics layout based on user feedback to achieve a perfect 50:50 balance between the album/controls panel and the lyrics panel.

## UI Improvements
- **Strict 50:50 Split**: Both the album/controls panel and lyrics panel now occupy exactly half of the screen width (`w-1/2`).
- **Centered Album Art**: The album art and controls are now centered within their panel with a constrained width (`max-w-[320px]`), preventing them from stretching too wide.
- **Improved Spacing**: Added more horizontal padding to the left panel and adjusted responsive padding for the lyrics panel.
