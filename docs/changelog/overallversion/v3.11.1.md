# SONORA v3.11.1 - Apple Music Lyrics UI

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview
Revamped fullscreen lyrics player to match Apple Music's karaoke-style display with true 50:50 layout and dynamic lyrics visibility.

## UI Changes

### Lyrics Layout
- **50:50 Split**: Album art/controls and lyrics now share equal screen width
- **Removed max-width constraint** from left panel for true half-screen layout

### Dynamic Lyrics Display (Apple Music Style)
- **Past Lyrics**: Collapse and hide (height 0, opacity 0) during playback
- **Current Lyric**: Full visibility with glow effect
- **Future Lyrics**: Visible but blurred (2px blur, 60% opacity)
- **Scroll Mode**: Scrolling reveals all lyrics for 3 seconds, then returns to karaoke mode

### Technical
- Added `isUserScrolling` state with 3-second timeout
- Added `onScroll` handler for scroll detection
- Smooth CSS transitions for collapse/expand animations
