# SONORA v3.11.3 - UI Visual Refinements

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview
This update focuses on refining the Fullscreen Lyrics visual experience to closely duplicate the Apple Music "Sing" aesthetic, following user feedback.

## UI Improvements
- **Layout Adjustments**: Reduced the visual footprint of the album art and controls (Left Panel) while providing more screen real estate to the lyrics (Right Panel).
- **Typography**: Significantly increased font sizes for lyrics. The active line is now larger and bolder, improving readability at a distance.
- **Centering**: Improved the vertical positioning logic. The active lyric now stays strictly centered on the screen with ample top/bottom spacing.
- **Dark Mode Aesthetics**: Added a subtle dark overlay to the dynamic background, ensuring high text contrast while maintaining the colorful "orb" atmosphere.
