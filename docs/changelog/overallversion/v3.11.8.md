# SONORA v3.11.8 - Word Timing for All Lyrics Sources

**Release Date:** 2025-12-19

## Bug Fixes
- **Word Timing Estimation**: Added word timing estimation for non-Musixmatch lyrics sources (Syncedlyrics, LRCLIB).
- Karaoke highlight effect now works for all lyrics, not just Musixmatch.
- Words are highlighted progressively based on estimated timing derived from line duration.

## Technical Notes
- Musixmatch API currently returns 401 errors - investigating alternative solutions.
- Syncedlyrics remains the reliable fallback source with estimated word timing.
