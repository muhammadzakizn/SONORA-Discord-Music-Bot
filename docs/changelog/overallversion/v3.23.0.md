## Web Changes

### Admin Dashboard - Other Servers Enhancement

  - Format: "{username} paused playback", "{username} skipped to next track"
  - Notifications broadcast via SocketIO to all connected users

#### Server Filtering  
- **Role Separation**: "Servers You Manage" for Owner/Admin, "Other Servers" for Member + SONORA present
