# SONORA v3.11.2 - WebGL Animation Refinement

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Overview
Refined WebGL background animation to fully replicate the `beautiful-lyrics` extension visual style.

## Visual Improvements
- **Circular Texture Masking**: Implemented proper circular cropping of album art before blurring.
- **Improved Blending**: The animation now renders distinct "orbs" of color that rotate, rather than a generic blurred background.
- **Matched Reference Logic**: Coordinate system and blur amounts adjusted to match the original reference implementation exactly.
