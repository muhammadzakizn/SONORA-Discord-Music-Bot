# Web Changelog v3.9.3 - Lyrics UI Refinements

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Visual Enhancements
### Fullscreen Lyrics Player
- **Apple Music-Style Layout**: Adjusted the split-screen ratio (5/12 for controls, 7/12 for lyrics) and constrained the album art size.
- **Improved Typography**: Increased font sizes for all lyrics. Current line is now `text-4xl`/`text-5xl` for emphasis.
- **Better Centering**: Increased vertical padding (`40vh`) to ensure the active line is always visually centered on the screen.
- **Background Contrast**: Integrated a dark overlay to mix black accents into the colorful WebGL background, improving text legibility and visual depth.
