# Web Changelog v3.9.4 - Balanced 50:50 Layout

**Release Date:** 2025-12-18

## Layout Refinements
### Fullscreen Lyrics Player
- **50:50 Split Ratio**: Both panels now use `w-1/2` for a perfectly balanced layout.
- **Centered Content**: Album art and controls are wrapped in a centered container with `max-w-[320px]` to prevent stretching.
- **Proper Margins**: Increased horizontal padding on the left panel (`px-16`) for better visual balance.
